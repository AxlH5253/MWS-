Mobile Webe Specialist Project For Google Developer Kejar 2018

this is a project that I made when I took part in the training of google developer chasing 2018. 
on this project I created a simple web that has a mobile display according to the level used to access it.

some features of this website are:
- css grid
- leaflet map
- fetch json
- wait and promise
- PWA (Progresif Web Apps)
